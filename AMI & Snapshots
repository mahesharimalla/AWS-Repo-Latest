AWS EC2 Part-1

* VM
* Snapshots
* Load Balancers
* Auto Scaling Groups

Snapshot is a point in time backup of specific volume while AMI is is backup of the entire EC2 instance that might have multiple attached volumes, exactly like virtual machines. 
With Packer, you can build automated machine images including AMIs for EC2, VMDK/VMX files for VMware, OVF exports for VirtualBox, etc.
